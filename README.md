* Urban cities make up for majority of the percent of total fares, total rides and total drivers.

* The driver count for Urban cities is significantly higher compared to the driver
  count for the Rural and Suburban cities.

* The average fare is higher in Rural cities.

* The driver count negatively correlates with the average fares per city type. (Ex: The higher the driver count, the less expensive the average fare. And the lower the driver count the more expensive the average fare).
